e-menu is a generic menu editor to create menus on-the-fly through
online editor. Unlike static menus, the e-menus can be added and removed
directly from the browser. This can be particularly useful if you 
frequently update menus. The menus are stored in mysql database and are 
retrieved for display.

Installation:
-------------
1) Create mysql database 
   Example: 
   > create database 'emenu';
   > grant all privileges on `emenu`.* to `menu-user`@`localhost` identified
     by 's3cr37passw0rd';
2) Import e-menu.sql file
   $ mysql -p -u menu-user emenu < e-menu.sql
   
   You may delete e-menu.sql after importing it.
   
2) Modify include/config.php to match the db details above
   Example: 
   define('DB_HOST','localhost');
   define('DB_NAME','emenu');
   define('DB_USER','menu-user');
   define('DB_PASS','s3cr37passw0rd');
3) Have fun.

Notes on Security:
1) All numeric ID variables are sanitized by in-built function intval.
2) All strings are sanitized by custom function filter before storing in the
   database.
2) All variables are sanitized by custom function filterdisplay before being
   echoed.
3) all POST variables are sanitized automatically by custom function
   process_post_variables in config.php header file.

Enabling/Disabling Editor:
--------------------------
Modify this line in header file config.php and change the value from 1 to 0.
    define('EDITOR_ENABLED', 1);  ===> define('EDITOR_ENABLED', 0); 

When the editor is enabled, an exta editor menu appears on the menu bar.
To hide this menu even when the editor is enabled, change the value from 1 to 0.
define('SHOW_EDITOR_MENU', 1); ===> define('SHOW_EDITOR_MENU', 0);

This may prevent users from knowing the menu is in edit mode. The editor can
still be directly accessed through /menu_list.php page when editor is enabled.
